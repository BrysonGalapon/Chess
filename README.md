# Chess
Chess Project

You started this on April 25, 2016. Hopefully this turns out well... and if you didn't finish, I have a message for you:

I KNEW IT. MUAHAHAHA, you didn't have time to finish this right?.. RIGHT? I KNEW IT! You got sooooooo lazy didn't you, you were all like "Damn Cuh, it would be so cool to make a chess engine! Let's try to make this and find out how difficult it is". WELL ITS DIFFICULT AINT IT? Yo yo yo... took you forever to make the board and the pieces, let alone the GUI, the algorithm to play against, the parser... man this self profject is just too hard!

And if you did finish:

GG. Make it better now. And yes, there's always a way to make it better - Find it.
